Here are the example tests that come with the IMUnit project <http://mir.cs.illinois.edu/imunit>.

Directories:
src: includes all the tests used here.
Each IMUnit test is annotated with @Schedule and @Test. The original Thread.sleep() operations are not removed from the file but commented out. So, to get the original sleep test, comment out @Schedule and fireEvent, and uncomment Thread.sleep() in those IMUnit tests.

lib: includes all the jars used to run IMUnit and the test programs.

Files:
build.xml: ant script used to build all the tests. Class files will be produced under bin.

imunit.sh: bash script used to run the IMUnit tests.

LICENSE: our license file for the IMUnit project.

Instructions:

To build or clean all the tests, use "ant" or "ant clean".

To run a single IMUnit test, use "./imunit.sh test_class_name", e.g., "./imunit.sh edu.illinois.imunit.examples.jbosscache.ReadWriteLockWithUpgradeTest".

To run all the IMUnit tests, use "./imunit.sh all".
